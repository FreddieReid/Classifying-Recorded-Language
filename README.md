# Classifying-Recorded-Language

Throughout this report, we will attempt to create a model which can predict the language being that is currently being spoken.

The data was collected as part of the "Production and Perception of Linguistic Voice Quality" project at UCLA. In order to collect the data, a software called VoiceSauce was used.

The final voting classifier model uses a mixture of a random forest, gradient boosted forest and support vector machine to achieve an .81 precision and a 0.83 recall score.
